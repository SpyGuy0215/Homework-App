# Homework App

Have you ever been in this situation?
"Oh no, I forgot what I have to do for homework!"
Chances are, you have. Not to worry! That's what Homework.io is for

Homework.io is a homework app - with a twist! Its not the teachers who post homework, its the STUDENTS! 
If you remember the homework, there's a chance for you to help your peers by posting the homework on Homewok.io
Don't remember it? Chances are, a peer has already posted it on Homework.io. Take a look!

Homework.io IS IN BETA! **It is uncomplete and, as of 10/05/21, practically useless. Use this only if you want to help test it out!**
